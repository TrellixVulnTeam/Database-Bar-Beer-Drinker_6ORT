# The Bar Beer Drinker Project

## Introduction 
**Bar Beer Drinker** is about a number of fictional bars and how their businesses are currently doing. They only sell beer and food, some of which are sold at multiple bars. A number of customers ("drinkers") order beers and/or food at any of the bars, for which they are issued a transaction (or a "bill") by the bar. This project explores transactions made between 6 Oct 2018 and 20 Nov 2018. Information about the bars, beers, drinkers, and bills are stored in a database that follows the relational database management system. All information in this project are fictional. 

I recommend starting with the [front-end website](https://warm-temple-15359.herokuapp.com/static/index.html), where you can see several patterns of customer spending, derived from the transaction data, that may be useful to the bars to create business strategies that may increase profit.
