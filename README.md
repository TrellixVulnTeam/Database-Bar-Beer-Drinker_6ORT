## The Bar Beer Drinker Project

### Introduction 
**Bar Beer Drinker** is about a number of fictional bars, beers, and customers ("drinkers") who order the beers and/or food from the bars, and all transactions ("bills") made by any drinkers that occurred at any of the bars between 6 Oct 2018 and 20 Nov 2018. The information is stored on a relational database. 

The [front-end website](https://warm-temple-15359.herokuapp.com/static/index.html) describes several patterns of customer spending, derived from the transaction data, that may be analyzed to provide the bars with helpful business strategies to increase profit.
